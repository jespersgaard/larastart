# Larastart

## About
I created Larastart as I would often download many of the same packages at the beginning of every project.
I would always take too much time setting up a basic template structure, downloading jQuery, Bootstrap and generating the authentication files.
After a while it got a bit tedious so I decided to create a little package that'll download and install everything to my liking, all out of the box.

## Features
- Authentication scaffolding
- Migrations for users, forgot passwords and sessions
-  reCaptcha on register & forgot password
- Static Page controller (with tutorial for those that don't have much experience)
- User Interface updates jQuery, Bootstrap, Font Awesome
