# Larastart

## About
I created Larastart as I would often download packages, many of the same, at the beginning of every project.
I would always take too much time setting up a basic template structure, downloading jQuery, Bootstrap and generating the authentication files.
After a while it got a bit tedious so I decided to create a little package that'll download and install my everything to my liking, all out of the box.

## Installation
Coming soon...
