# Larastart

## About
I created Larastart as I would often download many of the same packages at the beginning of every project.
I would always take too much time setting up a basic template structure, downloading jQuery, Bootstrap and generating the authentication files.
After a while it got a bit tedious so I decided to create a little package that'll download and install everything to my liking, all out of the box.

## Features
-  reCaptcha (no captcha recaptcha always returns error, but old recaptcha still works)
- GrahamCampbell/ExceptionHandler
- filp/Whoops
- Authentication scaffolding
- Migrations for users, forgot passwords and sessions
- Static Page controller (with tutorial for those that don't have much experience)
- jQuery
- Bootstrap
- Font Awesome

## Installation
Coming soon...
